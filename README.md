Proyecto final modulo 2

Hi! This is my final project for the second module of my bootcamp (Full-stack Python Trainee), 
in which we have to put in practice all that we learnt regarding HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Also we learnt (and I used here) Bootstrap 5, JQuery, and the use of an API, in this case regarding Digimon.
